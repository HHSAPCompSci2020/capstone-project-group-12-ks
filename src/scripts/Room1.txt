“What Happened” - Kenjiro
I say as hand reaches for my head
An unbearable headache assualts me
I manage to get up only to see my friends slowly awakening as well
---Kenjiro+Friends
“Argh” - Friends
My friends struggle to get off the ground
I look around us
Whattt the
We’re indoors
How…
The last I remember I was adventuring in the woods with my friends
Now we’re all unconscious in this cavern looking place 
No it's more like a Dungeon
“Hey Kenjiro you good?” - Takumi (Friend)
“Huh? Why are you saying that Takumi?” - Kenjiro
“Your armor...it's all gone...even your weapon…” - Takumi (Friend)
“What???” - Kenjiro
I look down at myself
He’s right
The armor on my body is gone
All I am wearing are some tattered rags
The sword that hung at my belt is no longer there either
On the floor where I woke up from lay a rusty sword in poor condition
But it’s not the sword I wielded when we were in the woods.
We are adventurers after all
And monsters are everywhere in this world
In order to prevent monsters from terrorizing the human race
Warriors from all around the world gathered to fight them
These warriors were called adventurers
However Adventurers never consisted of only swordsmen
Mages, Archers, Spearmen, what ever class of fighter existed could be an adventurer
My friends and I are adventurers
My friends and I were hunting an ogre in woods that had escaped from terrorizing the city
“Get up guys. We need to get out of here fast” - Kenjiro
"Kenjiro LOOK over there!!" - Friends
